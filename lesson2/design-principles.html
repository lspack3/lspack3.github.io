            <h2>Principle 1: Contrast</h2>
            <h3>Odd Pears</h3>
            <a href="https://www.oddpears.com/collections/casual-socks">Odd Pears Website</a></li>
            <img src="/images/oddpears.png" alt="Odd Pears screenshot of contrast">
                <p>Odd Pears is a website that specializes in selling unique and very colorful socks.
                Their website is a great example of contrast in design. The salmon pink tags on the dark
                blue banner stand out on the white background. Not to mention all the other bright colors
                and fun designs on the socks that just pop. The eye can't help but be drawn to all the
                action happening with the contrast on this site!
                </p>

            <h2>Principle 2: Repetition</h2>
            <h3>Kohl's</h3>
            <a href="https://www.kohls.com/catalog/sale.jsp?CN=Promotions:Sale&cc=saleclearance-TN1.0-S-saleclearance&kls_sbp=48647803288227209521044016642349135380">
                Kohl's Website</a></li>
            <img src="/images/kohls.png" alt="Kohls screenshot of repetition">
                <p>Kohl's is a popular department store to Americans. Thier site is a great example of the
                use of repetition in web design. The left panel is the perfect spot to see repetition.
                Here you can see the same font, color, size, and icons all repeated. It demonstrates order.
                You can even see repetition being used near the top of the page with the category images.
                </p>

            <h2>Principle 3: The Rule of Thirds</h2>
            <h3>Build In Amsterdam</h3>
            <a href="https://www.buildinamsterdam.com/cases">Build In Amsterdam Website</a></li>
            <img src="/images/buildInAmsterdam.png" alt="Build In Amsterdam screenshot of the rule of thirds">
                <p>Build In Amsterdam is a branding company. Their entire site is built around the
                rule of thirds. The home page of this site is a simple example showing the screen 
                divided into three sections or three images. The line of focus is drawn to the
                intersections of the 3x3 grid that the rule of thirds implements.
